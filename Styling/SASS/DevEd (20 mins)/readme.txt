What you can do with SASS:

- Create variables (CSS supports that too)
- Nesting elements and "effects" such as hover, after, etc...
- Import other scss files
- Create functions (Mixins) for repetitive bits of code and pass variables to these functions
- Extend elements properties (inheritance)
- Math Operators

AWESOME STUFF!
